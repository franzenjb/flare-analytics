# Housing Age and Home Fire Risk in the United States
## A Deep Research Report for FLARE Analytics

**Prepared:** February 19, 2026
**Purpose:** Verify and expand on the American Red Cross claim: *"Homes built before 1970 pose significantly higher electrical risks."*

---

## Executive Summary

The claim is **well-supported and, if anything, understated.** The evidence shows:

- Residents of pre-1970 homes face a **17x higher fire death rate** than those in apartments built after 2010 (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2025).
- Homes with aluminum wiring (1965-1973) are **55x more likely** to reach fire hazard conditions than copper-wired homes (CPSC/Franklin Research Institute).
- Federal Pacific Stab-Lok breaker panels (1950s-1980s) have **25-65% failure rates** and cause an estimated **2,800 fires annually** (IEEE/Aronstein, 2012).
- Approximately **35% of U.S. owner-occupied homes** were built before 1970 (ACS, 2022-2023).
- Three out of five home fire deaths occur in homes **without working smoke alarms** -- a condition far more prevalent in pre-1970 construction, which predates all smoke alarm requirements (NFPA).

## 1. What Changed in Electrical Codes Around 1970

The period from roughly 1962 to 1975 represents the most consequential era in U.S. residential electrical safety. The National Electrical Code (NEC/NFPA 70), published by the National Fire Protection Association, underwent transformative changes during this period.

### Key NEC Milestones

| Year | Change | Significance |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1947 | Grounded laundry outlets required | First grounding mandate for specific locations |
| 1962 | All new 120V receptacles must be grounded and polarized | Three-prong outlets become standard |
| 1968 | NEC adopts 3-year revision cycle; new main panels must use circuit breakers (not fuses) | Fuse boxes effectively phased out of new construction |
| 1971 | All new homes must have grounded (3-prong) outlets throughout; GFCI required for swimming pool circuits and outdoor receptacles | The definitive grounding mandate |
| 1973 | GFCI required for outdoor receptacles at dwellings | Expansion of shock protection |
| 1975 | GFCI required in bathrooms | Wet-area protection begins |
| 1978 | GFCI required in garages and within 6 feet of sinks | Further expansion |
| 1999/2002 | Arc Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCI) required for bedroom circuits | Arcing fire prevention begins |

**The critical divide: Any home built before ~1971 was likely constructed without mandatory three-prong grounded outlets, without GFCI protection in any location, and possibly with a fuse box rather than a circuit breaker panel.**

## 2. Aluminum Wiring: Prevalence and Fire Risk

### The Problem
Between **1965 and 1973**, soaring copper prices led builders to substitute aluminum for copper in branch-circuit wiring. Approximately **2 million U.S. homes** were built or modified with aluminum wiring during this period (CPSC).

### The 55x Fire Risk Multiplier
A national survey conducted by the **Franklin Research Institute** for the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission found that homes wired with aluminum (manufactured before 1972) are **55 times more likely** to have one or more wire connections reach "Fire Hazard Conditions" than homes wired with copper.

**Definition of "Fire Hazard Conditions":** Receptacle cover plate mounting screws reaching **149 degrees C (300 degrees F)**, or sparks emitted from the receptacle, or materials around the outlet showing signs of burning.

### Why Aluminum Fails
- **Thermal expansion:** Aluminum expands and contracts significantly more than copper when heated. This cycle loosens connections at outlets, switches, and junction boxes over time.
- **Oxidation:** Aluminum oxide is a poor conductor, increasing resistance at connection points.
- **Creep:** Under sustained electrical load, aluminum deforms permanently (creeps), further loosening connections.
- **Progressive deterioration:** Failed connections deteriorate slowly over years, reaching dangerous temperatures while remaining electrically functional -- making them invisible until a fire starts.

### Alloy Change
In the early 1970s, manufacturers switched to a superior aluminum alloy (AA-8000 series) better suited for electrical work, but by then the reputation was destroyed and copper remained the standard for branch circuits.

### Recommended Fixes (CPSC)
1. **Complete rewiring with copper** (most effective, most costly)
2. **COPALUM crimps** -- connecting copper pigtails to aluminum wire using a special metal sleeve and powered crimping tool (CPSC-endorsed)

### Insurance Impact
Many insurance companies now raise rates, impose strict conditions, or outright deny coverage for homes with aluminum wiring.

## 3. Knob-and-Tube Wiring: Prevalence and Risk

### What It Is
Knob-and-tube (K&T) wiring was the standard residential wiring method from the **1880s through the 1940s**. It uses ceramic knobs to support wires run through open air and ceramic tubes to protect wires passing through structural members.

### How Many Homes Still Have It
Exact counts are not tracked nationally, but any home built **before the 1950s** may still contain K&T wiring. Given that approximately **8-14% of U.S. housing stock** was built before 1940 (with higher concentrations in the Northeast), millions of homes may still have some K&T present.

### Fire Risk Factors
1. **Deteriorating insulation:** The fabric or rubber insulation degrades after 80-100+ years, becoming brittle, cracking, or disintegrating -- exposing live wires.
2. **No ground wire:** No grounding means electrical faults can produce arcing -- a primary cause of house fires.
3. **Overloading:** Designed for minimal electrical loads (a few lights and a radio), these systems cannot safely carry modern loads (air conditioning, computers, kitchen appliances).
4. **Insulation coverage hazard:** K&T wiring is designed to dissipate heat into free air. When building insulation is blown or packed around K&T wires (as often happens during energy efficiency upgrades), heat builds up dangerously.
5. **Improper modifications:** Decades of DIY splices, taps, and over-fusing create additional fire risks.

### Data Gap
The NFPA and CPSC **do not track fires specifically attributed to knob-and-tube wiring** in their national databases. This is a significant data gap, but the known risk factors are well-documented.

### Insurance Impact
Many insurers refuse coverage for homes with K&T wiring, or require immediate upgrade as a condition of the policy.

## 4. Percentage of U.S. Housing Stock Built Before 1970

### Census Data

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Owner-occupied homes built before 1970 | **~35%** | American Community Survey, 2022-2023 |
| All housing units built before 1970 | **~44%** | American Housing Survey, 2009 |
| Owner-occupied homes built before 1980 | **~48%** (2023), ~60% (2022) | ACS 2022-2023 |
| Median age of owner-occupied homes | **41 years** (2023) | ACS 2023 |
| Median age trend | Rose from **31 years** (2005) to **41 years** (2023) | ACS |
| Share of stock 53+ years old | **35%** (2022), up from **29%** (2012) | ACS |

**The housing stock is aging rapidly.** New construction (built within past 12 years) declined from 17% of stock in 2012 to just 11% in 2022, while the share of 50+ year-old homes grows every year.

## 5. Do Older Homes Actually Have Higher Fire Rates?

### The Pew Charitable Trusts Study (2025) -- The Definitive Analysis

In September 2025, the Pew Charitable Trusts published the **first-ever analysis** of U.S. fire deaths by building type AND age, using 2023 USFA data (NFIRS + media-reported fire fatalities) matched to property records.

**Key findings:**

| Housing Type | Fire Death Rate (per million residents, 2023) |
|---|---|
| Pre-2000 apartments | **7.7** |
| All single-family homes | **7.6** |
| Post-2000 apartments | **1.2** |
| Post-2010 apartments | **~0.5** |

**Critical statistic: Residents of homes built before 1970 face a fire death risk 17 times higher than those in apartments built after 2010.**

Additional findings:
- Among the ~8.3 million Americans living in apartments built since 2010, only **four died** in a residential fire in 2023.
- 6% of Americans live in post-2000 apartments, but they account for only **1% of fire deaths**.
- Fire death rates are similar for single-family and multifamily housing built before 1980, after which multifamily begins showing greater reductions.
- The NFPA confirms this trend: the rate of deaths per incident has **declined in multifamily housing** since 1980, while the rate in **one- and two-family homes has not**.

### Demographic Compounding
- **67% of Americans aged 55+** live in single-family homes built before 2000 (the riskiest category).
- Only **3% of Americans aged 55+** live in apartments built after 2000 (the safest category).
- Older adults are already **2.5-2.7x more likely** to die in a residential fire than the general population (USFA).

## 6. Outdated Electrical Panels: Federal Pacific and Zinsco

### Federal Pacific Electric (FPE) Stab-Lok Panels

**Era of installation:** 1950s through 1980s
**Problem:** Stab-Lok breakers frequently fail to trip during overcurrent or short-circuit conditions.

**Failure rates (CPSC testing):**
- **85%** of double-pole breakers failed one or more UL test criteria
- **39%** of single-pole breakers failed one or more UL test criteria

**Updated independent testing (Aronstein/IEEE, 2012):**
- Breakers never manually switched: **25% double-pole failure, 51% single-pole failure** -- and they then locked up permanently
- Breakers previously switched: **36% double-pole failure, 65% single-pole failure**

**Fire impact (estimated annually):**
- **~2,800 residential fires**
- **~13 deaths**
- **~116 injuries**
- **~$40 million in property damage**

**Fraud:** In a 1980s court case, it was revealed that Federal Pacific committed fraud, labeling breakers as meeting UL standards when testing showed they did not.

### Zinsco Panels

**Era of installation:** 1930s through mid-1970s (production halted ~1980)
**Problem:** Breakers can weld themselves to the bus bar, meaning electricity continues to flow even when the breaker appears "off." Aluminum bus bars corrode over time, causing connectivity loss and arcing.

### Insurance Impact
Some insurance providers have stopped writing policies on properties with FPE or Zinsco panels. A fire caused by a known-defective panel **may not be covered** if the insurer was unaware.

## 7. Building Code Evolution: Fire Safety Differences

### Pre-1970 Construction (Before Modern Fire Codes)
- **No smoke alarms required** (first recommended 1973, first mandated 1976)
- **No GFCI protection** anywhere (first required 1971 for pools/outdoor)
- **No AFCI protection** (first required 2002 for bedrooms)
- **No residential sprinkler requirements** (not in model codes until 2009 IRC)
- **Fuse boxes** rather than circuit breakers common (breakers phased in via 1968 NEC)
- **Ungrounded two-prong outlets** legal until 1962/1971
- **No fire stops in balloon-frame construction** (standard through ~1940s)
- **No interconnected smoke alarms** (first required 1989)

### Post-1970 to 2000 (Transitional Era)
- Smoke alarms gradually required: every home (1976), every floor (1988), every bedroom (1991)
- GFCI expanded: bathrooms (1975), garages (1978), kitchens (1987), basements (1990)
- Hardwired + battery backup smoke alarms required (1995)
- Circuit breakers standard in all new panels
- Platform framing replaced balloon framing (fire stops built in)
- AFCI for bedrooms (1999/2002)

### Post-2000 (Modern Era)
- AFCI expanded: all living areas (2008 NEC), kitchens/laundry (2014)
- Residential sprinklers in IRC model code (2009, effective 2011) -- though adoption varies by state
- Self-closing apartment doors, fireproof stairwells, fire-resistant materials standard in multifamily
- Interconnected, hardwired smoke alarms with battery backup in all bedrooms and on all levels
- **Result: Post-2010 apartments have a fire death rate of ~0.5 per million -- roughly 1/15th the rate of pre-2000 housing**

### The "Grandfathering" Problem
Pre-1970 buildings are generally exempt from modern code requirements unless they undergo major renovation. The NEC does not require upgrades to existing homes unless new work is performed. This means millions of homes legally operate with wiring, panels, and fire safety systems that would be completely impermissible in new construction.

## 8. Smoke Alarms in Older Construction

### The Pre-1970 Gap
- In the 1960s, **almost no homes had smoke alarms** -- they cost hundreds of dollars each
- The first affordable battery-powered detector (SmokeGard 700) was invented in **1969**
- The NFPA first recommended alarms in all homes in **1973**
- The Life Safety Code first **required** smoke alarms in every home in **1976**
- By 1980, only **50%** of homes had any alarm; by 1984, **75%**
- Current estimates: **96% of homes** have at least one smoke alarm installed (2013 survey)

### The Working Alarm Problem
- An estimated **30% of installed smoke alarms are not working** (dead batteries, removed, aged out)
- Only **22.3% of homes** are "adequately protected" per NFPA guidelines (alarms in all required locations, all functioning)
- **Newer homes (86%)** are more likely to have working smoke alarms than **older homes (less than 74%)**

### Impact on Fire Deaths
- **Three of every five home fire deaths** occur in homes with **no smoke alarms (40%)** or **no working smoke alarms (17%)**
- The fire death rate is **reduced by half** when smoke alarms are present and functional (Pew, citing NFPA research)

### Why This Matters for Pre-1970 Homes
Homes built before 1973 were constructed with **no smoke alarm infrastructure** -- no hardwiring, no interconnection, no placement planning. Even if battery alarms are added retroactively, they are less likely to be interconnected (so a basement fire alarm won't wake upstairs sleepers) and less likely to be maintained. Hardwired, interconnected alarms with battery backup -- the modern standard -- require running new wiring through walls, which many older-home owners defer due to cost.

## 9. Other Age-Related Fire Risks

### Balloon-Frame Construction (Pre-1940s)

**Prevalence:** Estimated **5 to 8 million U.S. homes** still use balloon-frame construction, built primarily from the mid-1800s through the 1940s.

**The danger:** Unlike modern platform framing (where studs are one story tall and floors create natural fire stops), balloon framing uses continuous studs from foundation to roof -- 16 to 24 feet long. The open stud bays act as chimneys, allowing fire to travel from basement to attic in minutes with no horizontal fire barriers.

**Firefighter perspective:** "A small fire in a cellar wall will quickly spread vertically to the attic." Fires can travel inside walls without being visible, growing undetected until reaching the attic.

**Retrofit cost:** Adding fire blocking requires opening walls (removing plaster/drywall), inserting horizontal studs, then refinishing -- costing thousands of dollars per wall.

### Older Heating Systems

**Scale:** Space heaters cause approximately **21,800 residential fires and 300 deaths annually** (CPSC). Fireplaces and chimneys cause an additional **15,800 fires per year** (2017-2019 average).

**Connection to older homes:**
- Older homes are more likely to have outdated furnaces, insufficient insulation, and aging chimneys
- When central heating fails or is inadequate, residents turn to space heaters -- the leading type of heating equipment involved in fires
- Many heating fires in older homes are technically **electrical fires** from old water heaters and heat pumps drawing too much current through aging wiring
- Creosote buildup in unmaintained chimneys is a primary cause of chimney fires
- The leading factor in home heating fires is **failure to clean equipment** (NFPA)

**High-risk regions:** Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine experience heating-related fires at **4x the national average**, with many residents using wood stoves, pellet stoves, or older oil/gas furnaces in pre-1970 housing stock.

### Lead Paint and Asbestos as Renovation Barriers

**Lead-based paint** was widely used in homes built **before 1978**. The EPA's Renovation, Repair, and Painting (RRP) Rule requires certified contractors for any project disturbing lead paint in pre-1978 homes. This adds cost, complexity, and regulatory burden to electrical upgrades and other fire safety improvements.

**Asbestos** was common in homes built **before the 1980s** -- found in floor tiles, pipe insulation, furnace insulation, and wall materials. While undisturbed asbestos is generally safe, any renovation that breaks into walls (needed for rewiring, adding fire stops, or installing hardwired smoke alarms) can release asbestos fibers, requiring licensed abatement.

**The compounding effect:** The presence of lead paint and asbestos in pre-1970 homes makes the very renovations needed to improve fire safety (rewiring, adding fire stops, installing hardwired smoke alarms) **more expensive and more complex** -- creating a financial and regulatory barrier that causes owners to defer critical safety upgrades.

## 10. Geographic Concentration of Pre-1970 Housing Stock

### States with the Oldest Housing

| State | Median Year Built (Owner-Occupied) | Median Age (Years) |
|-------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| District of Columbia | ~1951 | ~75 |
| New York | ~1959 | ~62 |
| Rhode Island | ~1963 | ~58 |
| Massachusetts | ~1964 | ~57 |
| Connecticut | ~1960s | ~55+ |
| Pennsylvania | ~1960s | ~55+ |
| Ohio | ~1960s | ~50+ |

### Regional Patterns

**Northeast** has the highest concentration of pre-1970 housing:
- **14% of homes** were built before 1919
- More than **30% of homes** in Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island were built before 1940
- States where the **1950s** represent the most common decade of construction: Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, plus California, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Wisconsin

**South and West** have the youngest housing stock:
- Fewer than **2% of homes** in Alaska, Arizona, and Nevada were built before 1940
- The South accounted for a disproportionately large share of post-1970 housing construction
- Rapid growth states (Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada) have newer median home ages

### Correlation with Fire Risk
This geographic distribution means that the **fire risk burden of aging housing falls disproportionately on Northeastern and Midwestern states** -- the same regions with older populations, older heating infrastructure, and more extreme winter temperatures (which drive heating-related fires).

## 11. Studies Quantifying the Fire Risk Difference

### Study 1: Pew Charitable Trusts (2025) -- Fire Deaths by Housing Type and Age

**Citation:** The Pew Charitable Trusts. "Modern Multifamily Buildings Provide the Most Fire Protection." Issue Brief, September 30, 2025.

**Methodology:** First-ever analysis of all U.S. fire deaths in 2023, matched to property records for building type and year of construction, using USFA NFIRS data and USFA Home Fire Fatalities in the News database.

**Key finding:** Housing age is the **single strongest predictor** of fire death risk. Residents of pre-1970 homes face a **17x higher** chance of dying in a fire than those in post-2010 apartments.

**Fire death rates (2023):**
- Pre-2000 apartments: 7.7 per million residents
- All single-family homes: 7.6 per million residents
- Post-2000 apartments: 1.2 per million residents
- Post-2010 apartments: ~0.5 per million residents

### Study 2: CPSC / Franklin Research Institute -- Aluminum Wiring

**Citation:** U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. "Repairing Aluminum Wiring." CPSC Publication #516. (Research conducted by Franklin Research Institute.)

**Key finding:** Homes with pre-1972 aluminum wiring are **55x more likely** to reach fire hazard conditions at outlets than copper-wired homes.

### Study 3: IEEE / Aronstein (2012) -- Federal Pacific Panels

**Citation:** Aronstein, Jesse. Published via IEEE, 2012. (Investigation of FPE Stab-Lok circuit breakers, ongoing since 1982.)

**Key finding:** FPE Stab-Lok breakers are associated with an estimated **2,829 residential electrical fires annually**, with failure rates of **25-65%** depending on breaker type and condition.

### Study 4: CPSC -- Overall Residential Fire Losses

**Citation:** U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. "2017-2019 Residential Fire Loss Estimates."

**Key finding:** Unintentional residential structure fires result in an annual average of **360,300 fires, 2,390 deaths, 10,860 injuries, and $7.34 billion in property losses**.

### Study 5: NFPA -- Electrical Distribution Fires

**Citation:** NFPA. "Home Fires Caused by Electrical Failure or Malfunction."

**Key finding:** **47,700 home fires** annually are caused by electrical failures or malfunctions, resulting in 418 deaths, 1,570 injuries, and $1.4 billion in property damage. AFCI breakers (required only since 2002, and only in new construction) could prevent an estimated **50% of electrical fires** (CPSC).

### Study 6: NFPA -- Smoke Alarm Effectiveness

**Citation:** NFPA. "Smoke Alarms in U.S. Home Fires."

**Key finding:** The fire death rate is **cut in half** when working smoke alarms are present. Three of five fire deaths occur in homes with no alarm or no working alarm -- conditions more prevalent in pre-1970 homes.

## Summary: The Compounding Risk Profile of Pre-1970 Homes

The claim that "homes built before 1970 pose significantly higher electrical risks" is accurate and supported by multiple authoritative sources. But it actually **understates the full picture** -- the risk is not limited to electrical systems. Pre-1970 homes face a compounding set of fire risks:

| Risk Factor | Pre-1970 Homes | Post-2000 Homes |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Grounded outlets | Often absent | Required throughout |
| GFCI protection | Not present | Required in all wet areas |
| AFCI protection | Not present | Required in all living areas |
| Circuit breakers | May have fuse box | Modern breaker panel |
| Aluminum wiring | 2M homes at 55x risk | Copper standard |
| K&T wiring | Possible in pre-1950 | Not permitted |
| FPE/Zinsco panels | Possible | Not available |
| Hardwired smoke alarms | Not present | Required, interconnected |
| Sprinkler systems | Almost never | Required in many jurisdictions |
| Fire stops in walls | Absent in balloon frame | Built into platform frame |
| Electrical capacity | 60-100 amp | 200 amp standard |
| Renovation barriers | Lead paint, asbestos | Modern materials |
| Heating systems | Aging, often supplemented | Modern, efficient |

**The net result: a fire death rate approximately 6-17x higher in pre-1970 housing compared to modern construction, depending on building type.**

## Data Note for FLARE Analytics

For FLARE's county-level fire analysis, the geographic distribution of pre-1970 housing stock (concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest) may help explain regional patterns in fire incidence. Counties with the highest share of pre-1970 housing stock would be expected to have elevated fire rates, independent of other demographic factors. The Census Bureau's American Community Survey provides year-built data at the county level that could be joined to FLARE's existing `by-county.json` dataset.
